 <h1>
    <strong> ROME EMPIRE </strong>
 </h1>
    <p>Beginning in the eighth century B.C., 
    Ancient Rome grew from a small town on central Italy’s 
    Tiber River into an empire that at its peak encompassed most of continental 
    Europe, Britain, much of western Asia, northern Africa and the Mediterranean islands.</p>
    <p>Among the many legacies of Roman dominance are the widespread use 
        of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian) 
        derived from Latin, the modern Western alphabet and calendar and the emergence of 
        Christianity as a major world religion. </p>

            <em>
                After 450 years as a republic, Rome became an empire in 
            the wake of Julius Caesar’s rise and fall in the first century B.C. 
            The long and triumphant reign of its first emperor, Augustus, began a golden 
            age of peace and prosperity; by contrast, the Roman Empire’s decline and fall by 
            the fifth century A.D

         <em>A period of unrest and civil wars in the 1st century BCE marked the transition of Rome from a 
        republic to an empire. This period encompassed the career of Julius Caesar, who eventually took full power over Rome as its dictator. 
        After his assassination in 44 BCE, the triumvirate of Mark Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian, Caesar’s nephew, ruled. It was not long before Octavian went to war against Antony 
        in northern Africa, and after his victory at Actium (31 BCE) he was crowned Rome’s first emperor, Augustus. His reign, from 27 BCE to 14 CE, was distinguished by stability and peace. statue of the Roman emperor Augustus statue of the Roman 
        emperor Augustus Augustus established a form of government known as a principate, which combined some elements from the republic with the traditional powers of a monarchy. The Senate still functioned, 
        though Augustus, as princeps, or first citizen, remained in control of the government..With a mind toward maintaining the structure of power entrusted to his rule, Augustus began thinking early about who should follow him. Death played havoc with his attempts 
        to select his successor. He had no son and his nephew Marcellus, his son-in-law Agrippa, and his grandsons Gaius and Lucius each predeceased him. He eventually chose Tiberius, a scion of the ultra-aristocratic Claudia gens, and in 4 CE adopted him as his son. </em>

    <em> 
        Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was the final and most 
    devastating of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Iran.<br> The previous war between
     the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king <br>Khosrow II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrow proceeded to declare war, 
     ostensibly to avenge the death of the deposed emperor Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, <br> the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia, 
     the Aegean Sea and before the walls of Constantinople itself.While the Persians proved largely successful during the first stage of the war from 602 to 622, <br> conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia, 
     the ascendancy of the emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite 
     initial setbacks, to a status quo ante bellum. Heraclius' campaigns in Iranian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, <br> allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, the Persians 
     made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there. In 627, allied with Turks, Heraclius invaded the heartland of Persia. A civil war broke out in Persia, during which the Persians killed their king, and sued for peace.
